                        <p>I wanted to create a game, where player becomes one of hundreds knights attending a battle. Unfortunately plan was changed at halfway. What a pity, especially as I succeeded in creating steering similar to <i>Diablo II</i>. Doesn't matter... So the application presents as follows: the armies have leaders, avoid each other and they can pass by obstructions. One of them is controlling by user, playing the role of army commander. The system was enriched about detecting of collisions, what prevents the laying on the objects. Army’s algorithm is a stateless algorithm, the knights are testing the environment in every update cycle, and between cycles the additional information aren’t storing.</p>

                        <h3>ARMY'S ALGORITHM</h3>
                        <p>Army's algorithm is a modified version of flocking. He uses four classical rules: <i>separation</i>, <i>alignment</i>, <i>cohesion</i> and <i>avoidance</i>. In addition, he uses two new rules, modified rules of <i>alignment</i> and <i>cohesion</i>. This modification is dedicated to army's leaders.</p>
                        <p>Agents being inside the army are divide into servants and leaders. Class <span class="textCode">IBoid</span> inheriting from class <span class="textCode">IKnight</span> contains all four rules of classical flocking whereas class <span class="textCode">CSerf</span> also contains the additional modified rules. Class <span class="textCode">CLeader</span> uses only classical four rules except one – <i>the alignment rule</i>. Leaders don't use that rule, because only servants should adjust march direction to their commanders.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Modification of <i>the alignment rule</i> is forcing a servant to fit its walking direction to a closest another servant and a closest commander. This is illustrated below, black triangle is commander, and blue – an another servant.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Whereas the modified cohesion rule, on the picture below, is trying to directing servant to the closest commander, instead of army's average location. The more the servant is away, the greater the priority of distance reduction.</p>
                        <div class="articleGraphic">

                        </div>
                        <p>In case when all commanders are not in sight, the servant is using the unmodified rules of classical flocking.</p>
                        <p>In addition, knights are using fourth rule – <i>avoidance</i> – to driving alongside the obstacles and enemies. They're locating closest enemy and closest obstacle to react if distance is too small.</p>
                        <p>Army's algorithm has all advantages of the classical flocking, the reduction of memory requirements and reacting for environment changes in real time.</p>

                        <h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h3>
                        <div class="articleGraphic textWrapRight">

                        </div>
                        <p>Objects were designed in such a way to be like circles. That kind of design simplifies identification of collisions between them. It allows to use <a href="http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson19/">circle to circle collision detection</a>.</p>
                        <div class="articleGraphic textWrapLeft">

                            <p class="description">Obstacles</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In the simulation are two types of objects – knights and obstacles (stones and palisades). Knights look the same, only highlight allows to recognize the knight type. Commander from servant differs the shape of highlight, while one army from another army differs color of that highlight.</p>
                        <p>Knight has three parts – legs, hand with weapon, and trunk. In graphic files these parts are not overlapped. Thanks to this division, it's not possible to see situation when one of the knights is walking on head of another one. First, legs of all knights are drawn. Second, weapons and trunks at the end.</p>
                        <p>Grass is a set of identical-looking tiles. The tile was created by using filter in <i>GIMP</i> (<span class="textCode">Filters → Map → Make Seamless</span>). Thanks to this, grass looks like one extensive surface.</p>
                        <p>OK, I know that graphic doesn't look too good, and this bird's eye view without any perspective... Appearance was less important during creating this project so... It's just looks like looks.</p>

                        <h3>SUMMATION</h3>
                        <p>It turned out that flocking is a very flexible algorithm. It even can be used to moving the armies of knights. The only problem with the application is “shaking” of moving objects. Probable cause is continuous actualizing movement direction by knights. Fluctuations are quite intensive. The phenomenon has been minimized, but it's still visible. At least for me, because I have been fighting with that and I became allergic to it. Besides, I'm pretty happy with the final outcome.</p>
